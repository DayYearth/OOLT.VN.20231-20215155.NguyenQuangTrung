- If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build
a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this
=> No, cause if we do that, we will have 2 constructors with the same params, so IDE will through an error

- Is JAVA a Pass by Value or a Pass by Reference programming language
=> Java is pass by value language

- After the call of swap(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD) why does the title of these two
objects still remain?
=> Because java is pass by value language

- After the call of changeTitle(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD.getTitle()) why is
the title of the JungleDVD changed?
=> The method receives a reference to a DigitalVideoDisc object (dvd) and a String (title). It then performs the following steps:
1. Saves the old title of the DVD.
2. Changes the title of the DVD to the new title (title).
3. Creates a new DigitalVideoDisc object with the old title.
However, the crucial point here is that the reassignment dvd = new DigitalVideoDisc(oldTitle); only affects the local variable dvd within the method. It does not change the reference that was passed in from the main method.
